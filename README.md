What questions I would have asked my colleagues:

- Who can change the status of a project?
   - Only the creator can change the status

- Who can leave comments?
   - Everyone.

- How will comments be used in the future?
   - shared between classes, so i have created a pollymorphic association.

- Any more information regarding the comments and status changes that could be displayed?
   - time created and created by.

- Designs?
   - with the time available, started to implement basic bootstrap.

- Form submit over AJAX?
- Not needed for this scenario. Possibly it's clearer that changes are being logged on page refresh.
